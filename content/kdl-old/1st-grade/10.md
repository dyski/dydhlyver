#### Skrif
Write a letter in Cornish modelled on those in Dyskans 6 and/or 7, telling your penfriend as much as you can about yourself, your family, your work etc. This need not be factual, of course. If you cannot describe your job in Cornish, temporarily join one of the professions that have been mentioned in the course!
